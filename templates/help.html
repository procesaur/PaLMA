    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Application is developed in support of the University of Belgrade doctoral dissertation
        <i>Composite pseudogrammars based on parallel language models of Serbian</i> by Mihailo Škorić,
        under the supervision of Ranka Stanković.
    </p>
    <p>
        Usage instructions are shown bellow for each of three usage scenarios:
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Perplexity visualisation</h2>
    requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>Inputted text</li>
        <li>Selection of language model</li>
        <li>Slider size definition</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any kind of text is accepted as input. Inputted text will be truncated if too long!
    </p>
    <p>
        Easiest way to select language model is to paste its huggingface id, eg. <i>procesaur/gpt2-srlat</i>.
        The model will be downloaded to a local computer if it is not already!
        <br/>For visualisation language models like GPT and BERT (and perhaps other) should work.
        <br/>Selected model should ideally be applicable for the inputted text,
        eg. the language of the model and text should match.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slider size should be set between 2 and 10, and it will define the size of the token-n-grams
        being evaluated using the model, in order to produce the final values.
        <br/>The shorter the text, the higher impact of this variable will be.
    </p>
    <p>In so, the parameters
        <img class="helpimg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='help1.png')}}"/>
        will output:
        <img class="helpimg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='help2.png')}}"/>
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Generation</h2>
    requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>Inputted text</li>
        <li>Selection of (GPT) language model </li>
        <li>Outputted text length definition</li>
        <li>Temperature definition</li>
    </ul>
    and optionally:
    <ul>
        <li>Number of outputs definition</li>
        <li>Selection of the second model that will evaluate all of the outputs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Again, any kind of text is accepted as input. Inputted text will be truncated if too long!
    </p>
    <p>
        Easiest way to select language model is to paste its huggingface id, eg. <i>procesaur/gpt2-srlat</i>.
        The model will be downloaded to a local computer if it is not already!
        <br/>Any GPT2 (and just maybe another generative) model should work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outputted text length can be set to a 100 tokens max (if you do not edit source code),
        and it represents the length of the newly generated text, not regarding the input
    </p>
    <p>
        Temperature parameter set between 0 and 1 using a slider defines weather, and how much will the generated text be unique.
        <br/>Setting the temperature to 0 will result in most conservative generation,
        and setting it to 1 will result in most far-fetched text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Number of outputs simply defines the number of outputted samples the model will generate.
        <br/> If nothing is selected, default is 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second language model is selected just like the first eg. <i>procesaur/gpt2-srlat</i>,
        and any language models like GPT and BERT (and perhaps other) should work.
        <br/>This model will be used to evaluate generated samples.
        <br/>If it is applied, perplexities will be shown on the right side of each generated sample.
    </p>
    <p>In so, the parameters
        <img class="helpimg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='help3.png')}}"/>
        will output:
        <img class="helpimg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='help4.png')}}"/>
    </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Full Evaluation (Serbian only)</h2>
    requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>Inputted text</li>
        <li>Specialized resources and tools on the local computer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Any kind of text is accepted as input, but it will be truncated if too long!
        Of course, you should input text on Serbian or similar language.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are running this on a local instance, you probably will not be able to use this feature,
        as certain tools and files, such as TreeTagger and Serbian Morphological Dictionary is needed for preprocessing.
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>If you input a sentence:
        <br/><i>Tokom naredna tri meseca, Džejk i Nejtiri se zaljubljuju dok on počinje da se povezuje sa domorocima.</i>
        You will receive an output:
        <img class="helpimg" src="{{url_for('static', filename='help5.png')}}"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The graph represents different disturbances in perplexity (eg. semantical > orange and syntactical > brown)
        Above the graph nominal perplexity for each model is presented,
        and bellow the graph there are four different measures of the correctness.
        <br/>Each is tagged with either <b>OK</b> or <b>NOT OK</b>, followed by the probability of that choice.
        the four measures are:
        <ul>
            <li>General -- overall correctness</li>
            <li>Semantics -- semantical correctness</li>
            <li>Syntax (forms) -- syntactical correctness regarding word forms</li>
            <li>Syntax (word order) -- syntactical correctness regarding word order in the sentences</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
